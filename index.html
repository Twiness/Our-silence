            <p class="tab" id="tlp1">On May 12th, 2016, a man was brutally slapping and punching a woman on East Ontario Street in Philadelphia. The commotion caused by it attracted the attention of a man who started to shoot the video. In the video, even though the victim was pixelated, it’s still clear to

                while the man was violently hitting her. However, the fact that no one stepped up to help this woman is no less appalling than the man beating her repeatedly. According to Lieutenant John Stanford, there were at least 10 people at the</p>

            <p class="tab" id="trp1">A bus in Chongqing plunged off the bridge after it collided with an oncoming car in the opposite direction on October 28th, 2018. Fifteen people died including the bus driver in this accident. The CCTV footage inside the bus showed that one of the passengers was having a fight with the bus driver. After the passenger missed her stop and yelled at the bus driver, she hit him with her phone while the driver hit back with his arm in response. Shortly after that, the driver swerved the bus to the side of the bridge. People screamed as the bus hit on the railing. During the fight, no one tried to mitigate the tension. </p>

            <p class="tab" id="blp1">At a Deutsche Bank branch in Essen in Germany, an elderly man who was 83-years-old collapsed on the floor and hit his head on the tiles. He remained on the floor for twenty minutes until he received first aid. CCTV footage showed that there were four people walking around him in the bank and ignored him, it was the fifth person that finally alerted the medic. The man died a week later and the court found that those who didn’t help violated a law which requires them to respond to the medical emergency. Three of the four people who didn’t help were fined while the fourth one “was not ruled fit to stand trial” according to BBC.

            <hr>
            <p class="tab" id="brp1">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as known as UNHCR, was concerned and shocked after they learned the fact that a boat of 80 survivors, mostly from Eritrea, was adrift on the sea for more than 20 days without being offered help by many passing vessels. This lead to the death of the 75 people and UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic said that “As passengers died, the survivors threw them into the sea.” A fishing boat gave the remaining 5 people some bread and water, but no further assistance was offered. The boat was found and eventually, the remaining survivors received aid from Italy authorities on August 20th, 2009.

            <h1>My silence</h1>
            <p id="byline">By Twiness Xu</p>
            <p class="tab" id="s1">On October 5th, 2018, I walked into a Boba shop. Shortly after I arrived, an African American gentleman went in and attempted to buy something. He was waiting for someone to serve him even though I had gotten my order already. After several minutes, the staff members inside were still working on something else, leaving him to wait alone. He rang the bell, but only to find that no one would respond to him. He then left, with a slight upset look on his face.
            </p>
            <p class="tab" id="s2">This incident not only left me an impressive mark of how racism can still exist to this days, but also the guilt of doing nothing to help and the shame of being silent. I believe my lack of courage prevented me from speaking up, but that didn’t give me the justification to do nothing. The guilt from that incident taught me a lesson, which I also want to share with people who don’t have enough courage to speak up -- it’s hard to do something when injustice happens, but we have to fight against it, not only the struggle within ourselves but also the struggle within our society.
